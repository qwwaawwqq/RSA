# RSA Encryption Tool

## Overview
This RSA Encryption Tool is developed in Python/Java/Assembly and provides a simple command-line interface to generate RSA keys, encrypt messages, and decrypt messages. RSA (Rivest-Shamir-Adleman) is one of the first public-key cryptosystems and is widely used for secure data transmission.

## Features
- **Key Generation**: Generate RSA public and private keys.
- **Encryption**: Encrypt a message using the RSA public key.
- **Decryption**: Decrypt a message using the RSA private key.
- **File Handling**: Encrypt and decrypt messages are written to and read from files respectively.


Usage

Follow the on-screen prompts to:
1. Generate Private and Public Keys
2. Encrypt a Message
3. Decrypt a Message
4. Exit

How It Works
Generate Keys: The application prompts the user to generate RSA public and private keys.
Encrypt a Message: Users can input a message, which is then encrypted using the RSA public key and saved to encrypted.txt.
Decrypt a Message: The content of encrypted.txt is decrypted using the RSA private key, and the decrypted message is displayed on the console.
